Bandit is a tool designed to find common security issues in
Python code. To do thid Bandit processes each file, builds an
AST from it, and runs appropriate plugins against the AST nodes.
Once Bandit has finished scanning all the files it generates
a report.

Bandit was originaly developed within the OpenStack Securitu
Project and later rehomed to PyCQA.
