Light is a programm to control backlights and other lights
under GNU/Linux

Works where other software has proven unreliable (xbacklight etc.)

Works even in a fully CLI-environment, i.e it does not rely on X

Provides functionality to automatically control backlights with the
highest precision available

Extra features, like setting a minimum brightness value for controllers,
or saving/restoring the value for poweroffs/boots.
