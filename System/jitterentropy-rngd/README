Using the Jitter RNG core, the rngd provides an entropy source that feeds 
into the Linux /dev/random device if its entropy runs low. It updates the 
/dev/random entropy estimator such that the newly provided entropy unblocks
/dev/random.

The seeding of /dev/random also ensures that /dev/urandom benefits from entropy.
Especially during boot time, when the entropy of Linux is low, the Jitter RNGd
provides a source of sufficient entropy.
