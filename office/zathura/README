zathura is a highly customizable and functional PDF viewer based on the
poppler rendering library and the gtk+ toolkit. The idea behind zathura
is an application that provides a minimalistic and space saving interface
as well as an easy usage that mainly focuses on keyboard interaction.

Other plugins exist to support other file types:

zathura-pdf-mupdf - Alternate PDF renderer (faster, maybe more accurate)
zathura-ps - PostScript
zathura-cb - Comic book archives (cbz/cbr/cb7/cbt)
zathura-djvu - DjVu

When upgrading zathura, you must rebuild all its plugins
against the new version of zathura, even if the version numbers
are the same.

Optional dependency: office/texlive. If zathura is built on a system
with texlive installed, synctex support will be included.
