SVT HEVC encoder. Scalable Video Technology (SVT) is a software-based video
coding technology that is highly optimized for Intel速 Xeon速 processors. Using
the open source SVT-HEVC encoder, it is possible to spread video encoding
processing across multiple Intel速 Xeon速 processors to achieve a real advantage
of processing efficiency.
