Sparse, the semantic parser, provides a compiler frontend capable of parsing
most of ANSI C as well as many GCC extensions, and a collection of sample
compiler backends, including a static analyzer also called sparse. Sparse
provides a set of annotations designed to convey semantic information about
types, such as what address space pointers point to, or what locks function
acquires or releases.
