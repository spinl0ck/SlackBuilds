Spiro is the creation of Raph Levien. It simplifies the drawing of beautiful
curves.

Using b√©zier splines an artist can easily draw curves with the same slope on
either side of an on-curve point. Spiros, on the other hand, are based on
clothoid splines which make it easy to maintain constant curvature as well as
constant slope. Such curves will simply look nicer.
