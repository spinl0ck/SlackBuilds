ELFkickers is a collection of programs to manipulate ELF files.

The table of contents:

sstrip/
  sstrip is a small utility that removes as much as possible from an
  ELF file without affecting the file's memory image.

objres/
  objres is a simple utility that embeds arbitrary binary data files
  in object files as exported variables.

elfls/
  elfls is a utility that displays an ELF file's program and/or
  section header tables, which serve as a kind of global roadmap to
  the file's contents.

rebind/
  rebind is another small utility that alters the binding of selected
  exported symbols in an ELF object file.

elftoc/
  elftoc takes an ELF file and generates C code that defines a
  structure with the same memory image, using the structures and
  preprocessor symbols defined in your system's elf.h header file.

ebfc/
  ebfc is a compiler for a tiny programming language. The compiler can
  generate 32-bit ELF executables, object files, and shared libraries.

infect/
  infect provides a very simple example of modifying an ELF executable
  without affecting its original program.
