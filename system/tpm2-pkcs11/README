A PKCS#11 interface for TPM2 hardware

PKCS #11 is a Public-Key Cryptography Standard that defines a standard
method to access cryptographic services from tokens/ devices such as
hardware security modules (HSM), smart cards, etc. In this project we
intend to use a TPM2 device as the cryptographic token.

This build script provide two packages, tpm2-pkcs11 interface and
python package for tpm2-pkcs11 bindings and tool tpm2_ptool.
